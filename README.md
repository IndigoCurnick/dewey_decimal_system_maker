# Dewey Decimal System Maker

This software makes folders on your computer resembling the Dewey Decimal System
for organising books in a library.

Titles are as close to possible as the following https://www.oclc.org/content/dam/oclc/dewey/ddc23-summaries.pdf, aside from the following modifications

- `&` replaced with `and`
- `;` replaced with `,`
- General capitalisation
- In some places, accented letters have been replaced with ASCII equivalent
- Removal of `.`

These modifications are intended to ensure file names function on all systems
